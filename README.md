This is legacy code (Pseudomarker version 0.901) written in Matlab for
QTL mapping.  This code is being provided for the purposes of
reproducibility in case anyone needs it and has not been updated since
about 2003.

Its functionality has been largely absorbed by
[R/qtl](https://www.rqtl.org) written by Karl Broman.
